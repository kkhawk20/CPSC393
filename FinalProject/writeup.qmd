# Analysis

# Methods
Explain the structure of your model and your approach to building it. This can also include changes you made to your model in the process of building it. Someone should be able to read your methods section and *generally* be able to tell exactly what architechture you used. 

# Results
Detailed discussion of how your model performed, and your discussion of how your model performed.

# Reflection
Reflections on what you learned/discovered in the process of doing the assignment. Things you would do differently in the future, ways you'll approach similar problems in the future, etc.
