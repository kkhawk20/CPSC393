# Introduction
Write a few sentences about the dataset and generative models in general to help non-technical readers understand the problem.


# Differences Between Model Architechtures, Inputs/Outputs, Loss(es) and Training

Explain **in detail** the difference between how we generate samples in the 3 models (e.g. what are the differences in the inputs of each model, how they're trained, the types of layers, activations, sizes, the way they generate samples, their loss functions,...etc).


# Comparison of Outputs (e.g. quality, ease of getting new samples, interpolation/smoothness)

Your subjective opinions on the differences in the generated images (e.g. quality, blurriness, realism, ability to interpolate, ease of selecting a particular digit...etc).
