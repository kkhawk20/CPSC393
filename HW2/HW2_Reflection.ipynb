        "ASL is a prominent language in the American deaf community. With this in mind, I have a dataset of images containing the ASL dictionary, excluding the letters that need motion. The dataset was already flattened into greyscale values, ready for model input with a few preprocessing changes. This model will help translate ASL images to text for those who do not understand it, or want to learn it. \n",

However I did refer back to the math of the models to justify my answers and think about why the models performed the way they did. It was interesting to be able to quantify them with a simple classification problem and think about how each model handles class imbalances in the slightest way, by about 20%. In the future, I would approach it the same way as I did here, as it seemed to work well. \n"
